# Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction-
Handwritten Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis is to develop a highly accurate machine learning model that can classify handwritten digits (0-9) with precision and recall. The model should generalize well to new data, avoid overfitting, and be deployable in real-world applications, such as optical character recognition systems.
